# Interop 2022: Viewport

Work on the [viewport investigation project](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop-2022/issues/41) for Interop 2022.

> To sort out any confusion about what “viewport” means, and what browsers _(especially on mobile devices)_ should be doing with various viewport measurements & sizing. To make recommendations for what should change to improve interoperability.

## Tests

There are a bunch of test pages available that help you test the behavior of certain aspects in browsers. These test page are published at [https://interop-2022-viewport.netlify.app/](https://interop-2022-viewport.netlify.app/)

Included tests:

- [Initial Containing Block (ICB)](https://interop-2022-viewport.netlify.app/individual/icb/)
- [Layout Viewport](https://interop-2022-viewport.netlify.app/individual/layout-viewport/)
- [Visual Viewport](https://interop-2022-viewport.netlify.app/individual/visual-viewport/)
- [Virtual Keyboard API](https://interop-2022-viewport.netlify.app/individual/virtual-keyboard/)
- [Viewport Units + window.innerHeight](https://interop-2022-viewport.netlify.app/combined/viewport-units/)
- [Viewport Units + -webkit-fill-available](https://devinrousso.com/demo/WebKit/css/viewport-units.html) _(external)_
- [ICB + Fixed Viewport + Visual Viewport + Event Debugger](https://interop-2022-viewport.netlify.app/combined/icb-fixed-visual/)

The source of the non-external tests is [included in this repository’s `test` folder](./tests).
